<p>The L+PLUS Lab is directed by Dr. Laurel Lawyer at the University of Essex, Department of Language and Linguistics.</p>

<p> L+PLUS explores the human capacity for processing language.  Our interests range from speech perception to signed languages, from phonemes to discourse, from children through older adults, and from behavior to brains. </p>

<p> Interested in opportunities to do research in language processing?<br>
 Contact Dr. Lawyer for more information. </p>
