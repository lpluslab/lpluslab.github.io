<p>The L+PLUS Lab is directed by Dr. Laurel Lawyer at the University of Essex, Department of Language and Linguistics.</p>

<p> L+PLUS explores all kinds of questions on language processing.  Our interests range from speech perception to signed languages, from phonemes to discourse, from children through older adults, and from behavior to brains. </p>

<p> Come join us in the EEG lab next year!  Contact Dr. Lawyer for more information. </p>
