With <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/jerro06006/kyle-jerro">Dr. Jerro</a>, this is an inter-disciplinary research project on the semantic categorization of nouns into noun classes in the Bantu language Kinyarwanda (spoken in Rwanda). To date, no studies on the semantics of the Kinyarwanda noun class system or any psycholinguistic studies on the language have been conducted, and we seek to answer various open questions on the semantic nature of these classes. 
<br>
<br>
Starting with behavioral data, we explored whether Kinyarwanda speakers were sensitive both to morphological and semantic composition of nouns when asked to find the 'odd one out' in a group of three.  Preliminary results suggest individuals differences and additional languages spoken shape how speakers perform in this task.  (See <a href="https://osf.io/d2teq/?pid=skc86">our recent talk</a> at <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/bantu8/">Bantu8</a>!)
<br>
<br>
Next we aim to gather property norms from Kinyarwanda speakers to help build a dataset which can be used to quantify the representational distances between nouns in any given noun class.  Stay tuned!
