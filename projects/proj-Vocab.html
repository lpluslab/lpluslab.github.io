In this project, we address whether there's a direct relationship between linguistic experience, including vocabulary knowledge, and lexical access speed.  This follows from the suggestion that older language users might show slower lexical access times due to their increased linguistic experience and relative vocabulary size.  Lead by Willem van Boxtel, we explore whether a difference in language experience is discernable among a large group of younger monolingual English speakers, and whether there is a reflection of that experience in lexical access times.
