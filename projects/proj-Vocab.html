In behavioral studies, it is ubiquitious to find that older language users show slower response times across a variety of language-related tasks.  Whether this is due to a global slowing down of processing as part of normal aging, or, as suggested by Ramscar et al. (2009), related to the increase in linguistic experience found in older speakers is very much up for debate.

In this project, lead by Willem van Boxtel, we address whether there's a direct relationship between linguistic experience, including vocabulary knowledge, and lexical access speed in younger populations.
