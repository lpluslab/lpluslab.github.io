Scientific findings relevant to the d/Deaf community often fail to reach d/Deaf people due to their English reading ability and the costs of sign language translations. Working with <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/gutie34818/eva-gutierrez-sigut-gutierrez">Dr. Gutierrez-Sigut</a>, our aim is to increase access to research in deafness and signed language processing, and promote the co-construction of future research with the d/Deaf community.
<br>
<br>
We're creating bite-sized videos covering resent important research on d/Deaf language processing, reading, and sign language acquisition.  All videos will be in BSL, translated by a BSL-fluent Deaf research assistant (RA).  Each video will contain a summary of a single published article, pointing out the important findings, why it's important to the Deaf community, and critical commentary to promote engagement with future research.  Check back here for links when our YouTube channel launches in 2022!
