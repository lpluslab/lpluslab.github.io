Scientific findings relevant to the deaf community often fail to reach deaf people due to their English reading ability
and the costs of sign language translations. Working with <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/gutie34818/eva-gutierrez-sigut-gutierrez">Dr. Gutierrez-Sigut</a>, our aim is to increase the scientific literacy of deaf people and co-construct future research with them, though videos and discussion in a dedicated YouTube channel.
<br>
<br>
We're creating bite-sized videos covering resent important research on Deaf language processing, Deaf reading, and sign language acquisition.  A Deaf BSL-fluent research assistant (RA) will translate research summaries and help curate discussions on social media.  We hope by engaging in this space online we can promote future co-construction of research with the Deaf public.
